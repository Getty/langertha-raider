=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $raid = Langertha::Raid::Sequential->new(
      steps => [ $step1, $step2, $step3 ],
    );

    my $result = await $raid->run_f($ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Runs child steps in strict order and forwards one shared context through all
steps. Final outputs update context input for downstream steps. Non-final
results (question/pause/abort) are propagated immediately.

  });

  return await $self->_run_steps_sequentially_f($ctx);
}

=method run_f

    my $result = await $raid->run_f($ctx);

Executes all steps sequentially with shared context propagation.
